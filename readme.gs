Use code2.gs when you don't can't use API.

A Practical 2-Step Workflow ü§ù
Here‚Äôs how the new workflow will function:

1. The Script Analyzes & Creates a Prompt: The updated script will run as before, but instead of creating a generic, template-based reply, it will create a draft containing a detailed summary and a ready-to-use prompt for Gemini.
2. You Use the Gemini Chat Agent: You'll simply copy the entire content of that draft, paste it into your Gemini chat, and get a high-quality, AI-generated response to then paste back into your email.

Now, when the script runs on an email, the draft it creates in your Gmail will look like this:
